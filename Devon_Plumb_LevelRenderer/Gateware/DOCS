Gateware uses doxygen(www.doxygen.nl) to document the API interfaces for end users.

We are slowly moving to a full CI/CD development pipeline.
Eventually this file will be replaced with a hyperlink to autogenarated documentation.

For the time being however you will need to follow these steps to build the docs:

You cannot unfortuntely use Gateware.h directly for generation.(it would affect size/compile times)

Instead, download the whole Gateware repo to your local machine and extract it somewhere.

Download and install doxygen to your machine. (link above to installers)

Run the "Doxywizard" GUI front end for Doxygen.

Click File->Open and navigate to the "DevOps" folder inside the repo you extracted.

Select the file "doxyfile" and press the [Open] button.

Open the "Gateware.h" header file and note the current MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH versions near the top.

In Doxywizard replace the "?" values with the above values respectively.

Now select the "Run" tab and click [Run doxygen] to generate the HTML documentation.

Once it completes just click [Show HTML output] to be taken to the docs.

If you want to bundle it with the header just copy the newly generated "html" and "latex" folders.

We realize this process is a bit annoying, so we hope to automate it soon.
